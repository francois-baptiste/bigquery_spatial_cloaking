# bigquery_spatial_cloaking


This repo shows how to create cloaking regions to provide kâ€“anonymity for location based services. It leverages the integration of hierarchical spatial indexes on Bigquery using [jslibs](https://github.com/CartoDB/bigquery-jslibsBigquery).

### Examples

In the following examples, the [worldpop public dataset](http://worldpop.org) is used.


### Using Uber H3

### Using Google S2

* [Code](/S2/world_pop_cloaking.sql)

## Some thoughts

Kepler.gl and geojson.io has some problem displaying S2 cells near the poles so I had to remove some cells from the display in the example.
